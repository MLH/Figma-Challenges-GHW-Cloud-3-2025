# Welcome to the Figma GHW: Cloud Week 3-2025 Challenge Page!

Figma Dev Mode is a game-changer for developers because it bridges the gap between design and code by offering inspectable design elements, code snippets, and easy access to design assets. <br><br>
Quickly translate designs into functional prototypes, iterate on UI elements efficiently, and ultimately build more impressive and polished projects in less time!
